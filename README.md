# Notes on McQuarrie's Statistical Mechanics
This repository just contains my personal notes on McQuarrie's Statistical
Mechanics Book. Feel free to use this for studying or learning about the topic.
The project is currently just .tex files with a compiled pdf, but I may
eventually also convert this to a usable markdown/html project with links, but
only if I find significant free time. If you like the notes feel free to leave a
star.
